# Weather App

A weather app that has a few cities to choose from and shows a 4 day forecast. The logos and text output change based on the weather type, the color of the app turns blue when temperature is under 10Â°C, otherwise it stays pink. 


## The problem

The most difficult part is handling time input and converting it into the right format. Also timezones where very challenging.
